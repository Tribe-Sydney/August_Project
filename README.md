Build the endpoints required for a Blogging platform, where users can: - create account, update their account information, and also delete their account. - post blogs, update a blog post and delete a blog post.

# HTTP Methods used in the controllers

    POST - Responsible for account creation and blog posting

    GET - Get the list of created account and blogs

    PUT/PATCH - To update an existing account and blog

    DELETE - To delete an existing account and blog

    And for all the 3 methods use a single route to handle all the requests differently for the user and blog
